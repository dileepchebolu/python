## Difference between tuples and lists : In tuples, we cannot modify the list.  as in lists, we can modify, update and delete the list values 

list_values = ("dileep", "surya", "nagendra", "kumar")

print(list_values[0])

print(list_values)

## In tuples, if you want to modify a tuple, need to create a new tuple using already existed tuple.
