"""
Main Types of data we can manage in python is Strings, Intergers, and Booleans. 
and we can sort the data using lists and dictionaries.

And by using only those 3 data types we can not create all the things. So we have to create our own data types. 

Solution:
By using classes and objects, we can create out own data types

By using class we can create a data type and we can use that data type by calling that class. Using class we can essentially define your own data types.
