For printing some output, use below command 

Basically python is a interpreter. as like shell scripting. 

It will execute the commands sequentialy as like shell scripting.

While jave programme, needs to compile and it and then only we can execute that programme. 
print("Hello World!")

Variables:
    Datatypes:
        > Strings:
            ex: character_name = "Dileep"
        > Numbers:
            ex: character_age = 50   ## No need of quotes for numbers 
                character_age = 3.4567 
        > True or False values:
            ex:
                is_male = False
                is_male = True

Inputs (taking inputs in middle of the script):
    Note: as like read command in bash scripting.

    Ex:
        dileep = input("what you want to add here ..?")
        print("Hello" + dileep )
        

Lists:
    Sample programme:
        list_values = [ "kevin" , "Karen" , "Jim" , "dileep" ]

        print(list_values[3]) 
        print(list_values[0:4])    

        Note:
            If you select a range of 0 to 4 then print the values from index-0 to index-3 values 
    
    Output:
        dileep
        ['kevin', 'Karen', 'Jim', 'dileep']
